# PUMP CTF 2022 WEB challenges

This repository contains all of the docker-compose command and source code for the web CTF I built for Pump-CTF in 2022. 
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Feras454/Pump-CTF-2022-WEB.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Pump-CTF-2022-WEB
```

Each directory is a web challenge, and each directory contains a docker-compose file to run it locally.

```bash
  docker-compose up -d
```

You can change ports on docker-compose file to availble ports.
